- mailSet -- repository is an IntelliJ set of apps and will later included Excel Workbooks to fill out
PS3541 periodical presort US Mail.
- mailSet apps are a work in progress.  I hope to finish it during the next several month.
- I deleted the mailSet Repository Oct 15 2022.  
  I have not worked on it for multiple months.  Our periodical is slowly going out of business.
  I have a Windows VS apt that works well, and SO MUCH work to get the Java mailSet apt up to
  the level of the Windows apt (which is close to 20 years old now).  It's just not worth the
  effort.  And I'm 80 now.  I don't code as well as I use to... I just gave up.  (One of the reasons
  to write the Java apt was so I could transfer it easily to another, taking my position; but I
  think our periodical will die before I do.)
- 
- HGB -- repository (and examples) is an Android Studio package to generate a hexagon game board (HGB).
I had thought to write a game, based on hexagons; but found I am much better writing foundation code
than an actual game.
