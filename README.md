- HGB -- repository (and examples) is an Android Studio package to generate a hexagon game board (HGB).
I had thought to write a game, based on hexagons; but found I am much better writting foundation code
than an actual game.
- mailSet -- repository is an IntelliJ set of apps and will later inclued Excel Workbooks to fill out
PS3541 periodical presort US Mail.
- mailSet apps are a work in progress.  I hope to finish it during the next several month.
